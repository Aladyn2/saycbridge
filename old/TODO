- make the fallback bidder use support_points instead of high_card_points for suit fits.
- Opener's rebids and Responder's rebids!
- Preempts
- Preemptive overcalls
- Doubles
- Understanding Jump-shifts
- Fill in empty possible_resulting_history!

I need to have a high-level overview of how well the bidder does.
Being able to compare against all the unit tests results would be one way.
Simply making the unit tests write to stdout would be a start!

# Possible implementation for ResponseToOneOfAMajor:

    def possible_resulting_history(self, history):
        history_before_bidder = history.copy_with_partial_history(-1)
        if not self.matches_call_history(history_before_bidder):
            return False

        bidder = history.last_to_call()
        last_call = history.last_call_by(bidder)
        if not last_call.is_contract():
            return False
        partner_last_call = history.last_call_by(partner_of(bidder))
        if last_call.strain == NOTRUMP:  # Notrump is covered by NotrumpRebid
            return False
        level_change = last_call.level() - partner_last_call.level()
        if last_call.strain == partner_last_call.strain:
            return level_change == 1
        return last_call.strain != partner_last_call.strain and level_change == 0

    def update_hand_constraints_for_history(self, constraints, history):
        bidder = history.last_to_call()
        last_call = history.last_call_by(bidder)
        partner_last_call = history.last_call_by(partner_of(bidder))
        # FIXME: This is an incomplete implementation!
        if partner_last_call.strain == last_call.strain:
            constraints.set_hcp_range(6, 10)
            if last_call.strain == CLUBS:
                # Clubs can only be 3, so supporting them should mean 5.
                constraints.set_min_length(last_call.strain, 5)
            else:
                # Diamonds can be 3, but are normally 4, so we can support with 4.
                constraints.set_min_length(last_call.strain, 4)
        else:
            # Any mention of a new suit promises at least 4.
            constraints.set_min_length(last_call.strain, 4)

The goal of Conventions is to make unforced bids, which further describe the hand
or respond to conventional bids.

The fallback bidder is responsible for making bids when conventions don't cover things,
often retreating to cheapest notrump.

From Dana, needs to rebid diamonds:

From Nick, East jumps to 3N, when it should bid another suit first.

Another missing jump-shift?  Or should east have made a super-support game jump?

West can't bid 2C, it would be michaels:

Need an escape bidder which does not bid 2N:

East should not have bid 2N without a club stopper

East should probably just rebid his Spades.

North's 2N response was incorrect:

(I'm not sure that my spade rebid was correct?)

Confusion with 2n again, West should prefer to rebid his spades.

East should never have bid 2N, instead escaped to 2H:
