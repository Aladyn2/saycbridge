This frontend for SAYCBridge is written with Flutter, see flutter.io for more information.

Currently this is a frontend for the explorer, equivalent to /explore in the web frontend.

http://flutter.io/getting-started/ includes setup instructions.

You already have a copy of flutter in `third_party/flutter` via git submodules.
You will need a copy of the Dart SDK and Android SDK (and XCode tools on Mac).

Quickstart:
 - `flutter start` for development on your Android device.
 - `flutter apk` builds an APK (Not for release until https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/1010 is fixed!)
 - `flutter ios --init` builds an XCode project for use for building/running on iOS.
