# walk through all calls in the priority tree
# Add their constraint to an empty z3
# match your hand to that new empty z3
# if it matches, then add to your list and cut that branch
# if it does not match continue

# use a final tie-breaking priority to pick the bid from the list

(Or(clubs > diamonds, clubs == diamonds == 3) AND !(ROT AND hearts >= 5) AND !(ROT AND spades >= 5))

(!Or(clubs > diamonds, clubs == diamonds == 3) AND !(ROT AND diamonds >=3) AND !(ROT AND hearts >= 5) AND !(ROT AND spades >= 5))

Intrepretation:

# you have your existing knowledge
# Take the set of bids which have higher inter-bid priority than the bids your partner made
# take the negation of their constrait.  Add that knowledge to their hand.
# take the bid they did make, and add that knowledge to their hand.
